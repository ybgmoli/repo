<h1 align="center">Chud Repo</h1>

<p>None of the apps hosted in this repo are made, developed, or hosted by me. This repo serves as an easy way to obtain updated and safe mods.
It is recommended to use [Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather) instead of E-Sign if you have your own Apple Dev Account/Signing certificate.</p>
